Logistic Regression : Logistic regression is a statistical analysis method to predict a binary outcome, such as yes or no, based on prior observations of a data set. A logistic regression model predicts a dependent data variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variable.

What does logistic regression predict?

Logistic regression is used to predict the class (or category) of individuals based on one or multiple predictor variables (x). It is used to model a binary outcome, that is a variable, which can have only two possible values: 0 or 1, yes or no, diseased or non-diseased.

Naive Bayes Classification :

The Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm that is suitable for binary and multiclass classification. Na√Øve Bayes performs well in cases of categorical input variables compared to numerical variables. It is useful for making predictions and forecasting data based on historical result.

Artificial Neural Network:

Classification ANNs seek to classify an observation as belonging to some discrete class as a function of the inputs. The input features (independent variables) can be categorical or numeric types, however, we require a categorical feature as the dependent variable.
